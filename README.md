# Productivity & Efficiency Repository

This repository will contain every piece of code that was created in response to a need of automation or in general avoiding to redo things.

## (1) pyenv (Ubuntu)

Contains a script that installs pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv.  The need to automate arose from several problems I faced, from stolen laptops to broken motherboards (resulting in constantly using a new computer).  Instead of losing time installing pyenv manually this script does it for you.

## (2) torch_trainer

Implements a wrapper over the whole process for training models in PyTorch.  In the future I will implement logging functionality to see the output at every epoch step
and also prettify it somehow.
